# Wreck The Beach AR
Wreck The Beach ported to mobile, featuring Niantic Lightship ARDK.

An .apk file is included in the root directory in case you would like to play it on Android.

Repository for the original Wreck The Beach game: https://github.com/notyouravgjen/jam-jam2017

Device target was Pixel 5 (19.5:9 screen ratio) so apologies if any UI or game objects are positioned improperly on other screens.
